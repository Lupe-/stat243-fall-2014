You will need to create a private repository on GitHub for submitting your
problem sets.

1. Create a private repository on GitHub called "stat243" (without the quotes).
You will need to use this exact name (no space, no capital letters, etc.).
Select "Initialize this repository with a README" and choose "R" in the
pull-down menu to add a .gitignore file.

2. Add Chris (use his GitHub name: paciorek) and me (us my GitHub name:
jarrodmillman) as collaborators so we can push and pull to your private GitHub
repo. In the lower right-hand corner of your repository's main page, you should
see a button labelled "Settings". Click on the "Settings" button will take you
to a page where you can edit various settings for your repository. Choose the
"Collaborators" button on the "Settings" page.

3. Clone the repo to your home directory (I would clone it into a directory
just for repositories (e.g., I use ~/src). In the top-level of your working
directory, create a file named (exactly) `info.r` without the quotes. In this
file, you need to set the following variables:

-------------------------
name = "Jarrod Millman"
SID = "0123456789"
email = "millman@berkeley.edu"
github_name = "jarrodmillman"
-------------------------

The variable names have to be exactly as specified above. Then add, commit, and
push.

If you need additional details, here are more detailed directions that I
provided to undergraduates for a different class:

If you use the above link, make sure you don't just type in what it says to do
as you will need to modify the instructions to apply to this class. For
instance, use 'stat243' not 'stat133'. And make sure to add Chris and me as
collaborators (and not Karl or Inga).
