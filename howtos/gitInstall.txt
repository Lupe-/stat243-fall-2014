Install git by downloading and installing the correct binary from here:

If you want git to work with RStudio:

Here are some instructions from the RStudio page:
  http://www.rstudio.com/ide/<wbr />docs/version_control/overview
 
You may need to tell RStudio where the git executable is located as follows.
 
On Windows, the git executable should be installed somewhere like:
  "C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/bin/git.exe"
 
On MacOS X, you can locate the executable by executing the following in Terminal:
  which git
 
Once you locate the executable, you may then need to navigate RStudio's menu (maybe something like "Options->Git/SVN->Git executable") and confirm it has the correct information about the location of the git executable.
